# Hi! I'm Kyle and this is my Github!
## About Me
I'm currently living in the midwest working as a machine operator for a major beverage bottler, but have been working in my off time to learn the skills for a career in software engineering/development. When I'm not learning about coding I spend my time hitting the local mountain bike trails or working my way through my rapidly growing movie collection.

## Skills
After battling shiny ball syndrome for quite a while I've found a particular interest in data engineering, but have experienced several different fields, languages, and tools along the way.

### Most Experienced
* Python 3
* AWS Lambda
* AWS S3
* AWS EventBridge
* Pandas

### Some Experience
* C
* SQL
* HTML
* CSS

### A Little Experience
* JavaScript
* Apache Nifi
* Apache Airflow
* Jupyter Notebooks
* PostgreSQL

## Learning Path
I began my coding journey learning about web development through a bootcamp on Udemy. I learned a lot from it but felt that it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. From there I took the incredible Harvard CS50x course on EdX and learned so much about coding and how things work "under the hood". This course really took my learning up to 11 and helped establish a strong foundation for future learning.

After CS50x I realized I had a particular interest in the data side of things, and became inspired after reading about data engineering and the building of data pipelines. Following this, I got stuck in "tutorial hell" for a while reading books, taking Udemy courses, and watching YouTube videos. Eventually I got tired of this and decided I needed an origial project, which is when I got the idea for [SubTracker](https://github.com/kjqmiller/SubTracker/blob/main/README.md).

This project, which can be found on my GitHub, accelerated my learning by forcing me to solve problems on my own rather than by following along with a tutorial. It's a fairly simple project compared to some of the others I have seen, but I'm proud of it regardless as my first major accomplishment without the use of a tutorial to follow along with.
